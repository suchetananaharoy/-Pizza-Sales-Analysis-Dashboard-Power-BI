🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

This project presents an interactive Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard developed using Microsoft Power BI to gain meaningful insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends for a pizza business.

The dashboard analyzes key metrics such as total revenue, total orders, average order value, and pizzas sold, helping stakeholders understand overall business performance at a glance. It also provides detailed breakdowns by pizza category, size, and type, allowing identification of best-selling and underperforming items.

Time-based analysis is included to track daily, monthly, and weekly sales trends, making it easier to spot peak ordering periods and seasonal demand patterns. Visual elements such as KPIs, bar charts, line charts, and slicers enable users to interactively filter data and explore insights efficiently.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design within Power BI. It is ideal for showcasing data analytics capabilities and can be used by business owners or analysts to support data-driven decision-making in the food and retail industry.
